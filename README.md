# A simple algorithm for solution of higher order polynomial equation for real roots and determination of their multiplicities by the Newton-Raphson method
This algorithm recursively applies the Newton-Raphson method to find the real roots of a polynomial equation, implemented in Matlab with a GUI for visualization.
* For more info see the "Project Description and Algorithm.pdf".
* For a guide to using the algrothim see the instruction manual.
